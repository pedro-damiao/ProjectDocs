## Introduction

This project aims to build an RC car, focusing on the prespective of embedded development. As such, research on how to make an RC car giving priority to embedded development was done. Out of this research, came out a methodology of work, where all componentes should be bought as a self contained application for the car. The main components were identified, and these are:

1.  Chassis with all mechanical parts.
2.  Motor
3.  Battery
4.  Servo
5.  Motor Controller
6.  Radio Transceiver
7.  Development Board
8.  Controller with Radio
